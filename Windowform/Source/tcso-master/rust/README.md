There's also a version using a [global catch handler](https://github.com/panicbit/panic_search_rs).

## How to use with cargo

```toml
[dependencies.tcso]
git = "https://github.com/gautamkrishnar/tcso/"
```

## How to use in your crate

extern crate tcso;

use tcso::try;

fn main() {
    try(|| {
        None::<i32>.unwrap();
    });
}
```
